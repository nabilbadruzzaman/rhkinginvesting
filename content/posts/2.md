Junior Achievement Canada is an organization that delivers learning experiences to youth. The main focus of these experiences is to teach financial well-being, entrepreneurship and workplace preparedness. 
\
\
One of their programs is called [*Investment Strategies*](https://jaswo.org/programs/grades-9-12/investment-strategies-program/), a Canada-wide competition which gives you the opportunity to manage a $100,000 portfolio in a stock market simulation. 
\
\
The top competitors across Canada who grew their portfolio the most, will receive a funded $1000 [TFSA](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account.html)
from Questrade when they turn 18. Teams will split up the prize.   
\
The focus of this program is to teach the basics of investing in a real-world situation. You'll have to come up with your own investment and trading strategies to grow your portfolio. 
\
\
The simulation uses live-data and operates during trading hours. You'll be able to trade on the TSX, NYSE and NASDAQ exchanges during market hours. 
\
\
The program will take place during April. A trial competition will be held before the real competition starts.
