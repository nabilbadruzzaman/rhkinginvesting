[{"content":"Price vs. Value “Price is what you pay; value is what you get.” - Benjamin Graham When we talk about value, we talk about how much a stock is worth. When we talk about price, we talk about the price a willing buyer and seller agree on.\nPair of sneakers Imagine a new pair of sneakers is released, and just like any other pair of sneakers, it costs $20 to make. The pair of sneakers is so popular that it can be sold for $100. Buyers are willing to pay a premium for the sneakers (in other words, buyers are willing to pay a premium to its value). The premium may be a result of buyers believe the sneaker could sell for more, maybe there is a very limited supply, or it looks unique, or maybe it has intrinsic value (Maybe the sneakers are created by a famous celebrity)\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s a stock\u0026rsquo;s value? The value of a stock comes from when assets all sold, liabilities (debts) are paid, and leftover cash is given to owners.\nExample: Apple has $352 billion in assets, $290 billion in liabilities, and $62 billion in equity. Therefore, Apple\u0026rsquo;s value is $62 billion. If Apple has 15 billion shares outstanding, each share of Apple is worth $4.13. A company\u0026rsquo;s value is directly influenced by business performance. If a company reports a loss, owners have less claim over the total assets. This makes the stock worth less. If the company reports a profit, owners have more claim over the total assets. This makes the stock worth more.\nFuture benefits Not only do investors look at current value, they look at what happens to value in the future. We see investors will give up cash to companies when they think a company will perform well in the future. The same idea applies here. Investors are always looking to seek the highest growth in value, and will pay an appropriate price to do to. When it is expected that the stock will increase in value, the stock will appreciate in price. The opposite is also true.\nValuation ratios A valuation ratio compares the price of a stock to some financial metric. It’s important to the price you pay and the amount of earnings per share you will receive when you buy a stock. This is known as the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Example: Hershey\u0026rsquo;s stock sells for $181, and the EPS is $9.06. The P/E ratio is equivalent to the price divided by EPS, which is 20. This means for every $20 invested in Hershey\u0026rsquo;s it yields $1 of earnings.\nThe company\u0026rsquo;s bottomline A company’s profit is the #1 factor for price. A company experiencing growth in earnings will eventually see the price increase. We can project how profit will grow for a company to understand the price in the future. We can use a formula called the CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) This tells us how much earnings are growing per year. Example: Hershey’s EPS (CAGR) is 13% (from 2020 - 2023). This means Hershey’s grew their EPS 13% each year from 2020 to 2023. Using the CAGR, we can assume the EPS for 2024 would be $10.24 (9.06 x 1.13) If you were to use Hershey\u0026rsquo;s P/E ratio as of today, and substitute the ratio and EPS into the equation, the price would be $204.80. This will only hold true if the market keeps the valuation of Hershey\u0026rsquo;s at 20 times earnings, and Hershey\u0026rsquo;s will follow through with an EPS growth rate of 13%. However, the market does fluctuate in terms of willingness on how much earnings is reasonable for money invested. Sometimes, it is irrational (illogical), sometimes it is rational (logical). This means that perhaps in the future, there is the chance the market is only willing to pay $10 for a $1 of earnings, or it be willing to pay $30 for a $1 of earnings. We make money from security analysis by buying when the market is pessimistic about earnings, and we sell when the market is optimistic about earnings.\nThe topic of Security Analysis What we had just covered only scratched the surface of security analysis. For example, we looked at Hershey’s P/E ratio overtime, and had forecasted its earnings and what\u0026rsquo;s it future stock price might look like. The usefulness of security analysis is comparing a variety of financial ratios overtime, to competitors, and forecasting a variety of financial metrics.\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/6/","summary":"Price vs. Value “Price is what you pay; value is what you get.” - Benjamin Graham When we talk about value, we talk about how much a stock is worth.

As an investor in a company, we’d like to know the following:\nIs the company profitable? Can the company pay income (dividends) to its owners (shareholders)? Can the company manage its debt? Is the company growing in terms of revenue and profit? Such questions can be answered with financial statements.\nWhat are financial statements? Financial statements convey financial performance about a company. There are three types of financial statements:\nIncome statement: Revenues, expenses (costs in generating revenue), and overall profit over a specified time period (quarterly or annually) Balance sheet: Assets (things they own), liabilities (debts they owe), and equity (what owner’s claim) Cash flow statement: The cash inflows and outflows of a business over a specified time period Earnings Per Share EPS tells you how much income is generated for each share of a company. We pay attention to EPS to understand the profitability. Example: In Dollarama’s recent fiscal year, they generated $1 billion in net income, and had 283 million shares oustanding. For every share of Dollarama, you get $3.57 in earnings. When EPS is positive, it means that the company is profitable. We also want to see that a company is growing its income. This is demonstrated by a growth in EPS overtime. Current EPS and growing future EPS reflects good financial performance, which would be given back to shareholders in the form of dividends (income), buyback stock**, or to keep in the business for safekeeping or expansion. Negative EPS indicates the company is unprofitable, which can lead to financial trouble. We compare EPS of many stocks to gain an understanding of how stocks should be priced, and expectations on growth.\nEquity Growth If Dollarama made $1 billion in income, should shareholders’ equity go up by $1 billion as well? Not always. Dollarama had returned capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, totalling about $700 million. Because capital is being returned to shareholders, the capital is gone from the company. This reduces assets and equity, but capital is returned to shareholders, so it has no effect. This is an example of why it is confusing to understand financial statements. But there’s only a few areas which you need to pay attention to:\nCurrent Assets, Current Liabilities Debt Shareholder’s Equity Income Revenues Expenses Accessing Financial Reports Company websites have an IR (Investor Relations) section on their website, where press releases, relevant media, as well as financial statements are available. Finance websites like Yahoo Finance and TradingView, and databases like EDGAR and SEDAR. Companies report on a quarterly and annual basis.\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/5/","summary":"Measuring business performance It’s important to know how a business is doing.

A market is a place of exchange to facilitate the buying and selling of goods or services. Market participants include sellers and buyers. When we talk about the stock market, we talk about pieces of ownership (stocks) being bought or sold. \\\nWhat exactly is a stock? Also known as shares or equities, they represent ownership in publicly traded companies. Shares of publicly traded companies can be bought and sold on the stock market . Holding any amount of shares makes you an shareholder (owner of a business). You effectively own a larger piece of a company if you hold more shares. Corporations can have as many shares as they want. Example: Dollarama has 281.24M shares, if you were to own 200,000 shares, you would own 0.07% of Dollarama\nWhy have stocks? Companies often need to raise funds (capital) for the business. Examples of the need for capital are the TV shows Dragon\u0026rsquo;s Den and Shark Tank. In these shows, entrepreneurs ask investors for money in exchange for ownership of a business. Companies become publicy traded through a process called an initial public offering (IPO). An IPO lets a company sell ownership in exchange for capital.\nThe process of going public When a corporation IPOs, they issue (create) shares out of thin air and sell them to new investors on the stock market.\nExample: In 2009, Dollarama IPO’d, and issued 17,142,857 shares. These shares were sold at $17.50 each to new investors. Dollarama becomes a publicy-traded corporation. Shares of Dollarama can be bought and sold to other investors publicy.\nThe effects of issuing new shares In 2009, Dollarama issued 17,142,857 shares at a price of $17.50 each, Dollarama had raised $300 million. At the time, new investors are directly investing their money into Dollarama. Each time an investor purchased a share, they gave $17.50 in cash to the corporation, and owned a share. Dollarama can use the proceeds from its IPO for many possibilities. Some examples include paying down debt, expanding the core business, acquiring other enterprises, or researching new technology. However, because new shares were issued, previous owners who had held Dollarama saw their ownership in the company decrease. Example: Before Dollarama\u0026rsquo;s IPO, Dollarama had 30,000,000 shares distributed among two owners. These two owners own 100% of Dollarama. When Dollarama issued 17,142,857 shares in its IPO, the shares outstanding (total amount of shares) was 47,142,857. The original two owners now only own 64% of Dollarama. If Dollarama was to make a $100 million in income, the two owners would only claim 64% of that.\nThe benefits of owning stocks When corporations sell all their assets (things they own), pay their liabilities (any debts they owe), the leftover amount is distrubted to shareholders. This means that shareholders hold a claim of the corporation\u0026rsquo;s assets. This claim is simply called, equity. As a result of business performance, the equity of a corporation can grow. This benefits shareholders as their claim on the corporation is growing. Some shares come with voting rights, which allow you to vote for decisions to be made in the business You can make money if your stocks appreciate in price, and are sold for higher on the market than what you bought it for. You can receive dividends (income) from owning shares. The risks of owning stocks If you were to sell the stocks at a lower price than what you would originally bought it for, you would have a loss. The equity in a corporation can shrink, depending on business performance. Because shares are an asset, it is subject to market conditions, uncertainty, and business risks Other risks include economic risk, legal risk, policy risk, market risk, and liquidity risk Trading stocks Stocks are traded under an exchange, with a ticker symbol (nickname).\nExample: Dollarama’s ticker symbol is “DOL”, traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange, (TSE/TSX). You can refer to Dollarama’s stock as (TSX: DOL).\nStock exchanges only accept orders from members. Banks and financial institutions are typically members of a stock exchange. You’ll need a broker, who executes orders on behalf of you for a commission. Commissions from brokers are usually a fixed fee for a buy or sell order.\nHow do stock prices work? Like anything that’s traded on a market, a stock’s price is subject to supply and demand, which is entirely up to human behavior. However, there are distinct factors that directly influence supply and demand. For example, because stocks represent a claim in a corporation, if business performance is well, its value will grow, thus increasing its demand. Demand Factors:\nShareholders’ claim grows as a result of business performance Future expectations on growth Likeable management Comparison to other oppoturnities Ownership interest Supply Factors: If corporations issue more capital (stock) to new investors, this’ll dilute previous investors’ ownership, and create more shares that can be traded, thus increasing supply. A stock may be compared to other investments, such as stocks of other companies, bonds, or even real estate to answer questions like Why should I own this over anything else, Is it less risky than other investments?, How does this company compare to its peers?.\nExample: The government of Ontario owns 47.2% of Hydro One, a public utility company. Compared to other Canadian utilities, Hydro One has excellent high-level employees, is less risky due to their importance in Ontario\u0026rsquo;s energy transmission, and can fall under government support in the case of an emergency. The company has a long track record of growing revenue and income, and satisfies equity growth. These factors will make Hydro One\u0026rsquo;s stock relatively more in demand than other types of investments, thus seeing price increases overtime. The nature of a stock’s price is influenced mostly from demand. Studying demand is the key to generating returns (profit) in the stock market. Because we believe (most) companies will grow their revenues and income over the long run, which results in increased demand for stocks of these companies, we see that (most) of the stock market has performed well overtime. We’ll later go in depth on how you can analyze these factors.\nIndexes With so many companies listed on a stock market, it is important to know how they perform. An index measures the performance of various assets. The most popular index is the S\u0026amp;P 500, which measures the performance of the largest 500 US-listed stocks. On a long-term basis, the S\u0026amp;P 500 has returned 9.8% per year.\nInvestment products There are many types of investments. There are also many ways to invest in different assets. Investment products are the ways you can gain exposure to a particular investment. There are many investment products, but we\u0026rsquo;ll cover two for now, which are mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. Mutual funds pool money from many investors to invest in a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets. They\u0026rsquo;re managed by professionals, who charge fees. Mutual funds can target different investment goals, like growth or income.\nExchange-Traded Funds or ETFs, are investment funds that trade on stock exchanges, similar to individual stocks. They typically track an index, commodity, bonds, or a basket of assets. ETFs offer everyday investors broad exposure various markets, sectors, or asset classes. They provide liquidity, flexibility, and less fees compared to traditional mutual funds.\n","permalink":"//localhost:1313/posts/4/","summary":"What\u0026rsquo;s a market?
